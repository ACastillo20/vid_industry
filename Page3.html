		<p>(1967) The first video game console (working prototype) debuted as a bulky rectangular brown wooden box with two attached controllers, and thus the name "Brown Box". 
Invented by Ralph H. Baer (1922 â€“), also known as "The Father of Video Games", 
he developed the brown video game console such that it can be hooked up with any ordinary TV sets. 
There were only six simple games for the console, namely ping-pong, tennis, handball, volleyball, chase games and a light-gun game.

		<p>The golden age of video gaming has arrived! With progressively advanced gaming technology,the 1980s was a period of genre innovation when the industry began experimenting with non-Pong games like fighting, platform, adventure and RPG games. It is also this era that we saw the release of all-time classic games such as Pac-man (1980), Mario Bros (1983), The Legend of Zelda (1986), Final Fantasy (1987), Golden Axe (1988), etc. 
		There was also a major shift from dedicated consoles (with built-in games) to cartridge-based video game systems.
 Both Sega and Nintendo dominated the video gaming scene in that decade. The first console ever released by Sega was the SG-1000 in 1983.
 It was not exactly well-known since it was mostly distributed in Asia and never launched in North America. However, that machine laid the foundation for its top-notch successor in 1985, the Sega Master System.
  Nevertheless, the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) revealed in 1983 emerged victorious as the best-selling console of that generation. 
 It is even fair to say that the NES single-handedly raised Nintendo to a company easily identified with gaming.
